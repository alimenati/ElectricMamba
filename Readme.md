## Getting Started

To set up the required environment, follow these steps:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate mamba4ts
```

## Repository Overview

- **`PowerMamba`**: Contains the implementation of the proposed PowerMamba model along with baseline models.
- **`data`**: Includes the benchmark dataset used in this project.

Each folder contains a `README` file with more details about its contents.
